These files get loaded by this command in my xinit file:

% setxkbmap -print | sed -e '/xkb_symbols/s/"\(.*\)"/"\1+capslock(ctrl_modifier)+shift(both_capslock)+drew(tab_super)"/' | xkbcomp -I"$HOME/.xkb" - "$DISPLAY" 2>/dev/null

These files exist to let me map Tab as a Super key (xcape lets it function as
tab too) and the above command also pulls in some additional options that are
already a part of xkb:

- Capslock becomes a ctrl key (and also an escape key via xcape)
- Pressing both shift keys activates caps lock

Previously this was done with xmodmap but that caused problems with alacritty
after 0.4.1 was released and several other applications occasionally registered
double tab key presses too.

Turns out after a bit of research that xmodmap is generally only useful for the
most basic of tasks so I started digging into xkb and ended up with this which
for the moment at least seems to work without a problem.

Natefoo's xkb readme in his dotfiles repo was very helpful in figuring out how
to load these files in without editing a complete keymap dump so I'll link
this here: https://github.com/natefoo/dotfiles/tree/master/.xkb
